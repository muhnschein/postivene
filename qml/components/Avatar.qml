/*
 * A round avatar: the subject's own colour with their initial on it, or
 * their picture drawn through a circular mask.
 *
 * The mask is the whole point. An Image does not inherit its parent's
 * corner radius, and `clip` cuts only to the bounding box, so a picture
 * left to itself reads as a square among circles.
 *
 * Shared by the chat list and the contact lists so the two cannot drift.
