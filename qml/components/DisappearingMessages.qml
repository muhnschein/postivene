/*
 * How long messages in a chat live: the same nine choices the reference
 * clients offer, from off to a year.
 *
 * The core is what decides. The chosen index is bound from it rather than
 * held here, and a tap asks the core for the other value; the binding then
 * shows whatever the core says -- the same arrangement as the read-receipt
 * switch, and for the same reason. Silica's ComboBox writes currentIndex
 * itself on a tap, which detaches the binding, so the page puts it back on
 * every load.
 *
 * A duration another client set that is not on the list is still said in
 * the largest unit that fits it, rather than as a count of seconds: a year
 * set from a desktop showed as "After 31536000 second(s)" before this had
 * a year on its list, and the next odd value would do the same.
