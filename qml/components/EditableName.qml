/*
 * A name under a picture: a field, always.
 *
 * It used to be a label with an edit badge at the corner of the text,
 * which turned it into a field and back. Two states, a badge that had to
 * be found, and a tap before anything could be typed -- for a page whose
 * whole purpose is the name. It is a field now: centred under the
 * picture, in the same size and colour the name was drawn in, with the
 * line under it a field has.
 *
 * `text` is what was given here, which is what the page reads and
 * writes. An empty field shows `fallbackText` -- the name a contact
 * chose for themselves -- or the placeholder when there is no such
 * thing, both dimmed, as a field shows a placeholder. So a blank field
 * still says what the name will be.
 *
 * `hint` sits under it while the field has the cursor and not otherwise:
 * what the field means is worth a line to somebody about to type, and
 * clutter to everybody else.
 *
 * Used for a contact's name on their page, the reader's own on the
 * profile page, and a group's on both of its. Each names the inner items
 * for its tests through the *ObjectName properties, the way Banner does.
