/*
 * What a chat holds besides words, as a row of tiles on the page that
 * says who the chat is with: pictures and videos, sounds, files, and --
 * where apps are on -- apps. Each tile is the way into the page that
 * lists that kind (pages/ChatMediaPage.qml), which is where
 * deltachat-android and deltachat-ios keep theirs as well.
 *
 * A row of tiles rather than a list of rows, because these are doors and
 * not settings: four icons with a word under each read at a glance, and
 * the page under them stays short. Each tile is Silica's BackgroundItem,
 * so it lights up under a thumb the way every other tappable thing on
 * the phone does, and its icon is the theme's own for that kind of file
 * -- the ones the platform's file browser draws -- in the theme's own
 * colours. Apps are the exception: the theme has no icon for those, and
 * AppMark says why it draws one.
 *
 * Laid out by bindings rather than a Row, for the reason MessageDelegate
 * is: a positioner sizes itself in a polish pass, which never runs
 * headlessly.
 *
 * The row keeps its own room above and below the tiles. They are a third
 * kind of thing between who the chat is with and what the chat does, and
 * a column's own spacing does not say so; the page that puts them in a
 * column gets the gap without having to know how wide one should be.
 *
 * Nothing is opened here. The page that owns the pageStack pushes the
 * media page, which keeps this loadable, and testable, on its own.
