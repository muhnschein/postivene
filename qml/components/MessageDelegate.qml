/*
 * One message. Its own component so it can be loaded and measured on its
 * own, a row at a time, without the page and the model a conversation
 * needs around it.
 *
 * Every string here comes from whoever sent the message, so each one
 * that shows it is pinned to PlainText: the default detects markup and
 * switches to rich text, which would let a message body fetch a remote
 * image the moment its row is drawn. The one exception is deliberate: with
 * Markdown drawn, the body is the shim's own rendering of it
 * (markdown.rs), in which every character of the message is escaped and
 * the only tags are the ones the shim wrote -- and it is shown as
 * StyledText, never RichText, so nothing in it can load anything.
 *
 * Laid out by bindings rather than by a Column: a positioner sizes itself in
 * a polish pass, which never runs headlessly, so a row built from one cannot
 * be measured in a test.
