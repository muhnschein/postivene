/*
 * Raises a notification for a message that arrives while the reader is not
 * looking at the chat it landed in, and takes it back down when they are.
 *
 * One notification per chat, kept and reused rather than replaced, so two
 * chats talking at once do not overwrite each other in the notification
 * area -- the real Notification allocates an id on first publish and
 * `replacesId` reuses it. A second message in the same chat counts up on
 * the one notification rather than adding another.
 *
 * `ChatList` decides what counts as an arrival and never announces a muted
 * chat; this decides only whether the reader was there to see it, and how
 * much to say: the lock screen shows a notification to whoever is looking
 * at it, so `detail` follows the setting for how much it gives away.
 *
 * A tap on a notification comes back over D-Bus. Sailjail lets the app
 * own the name made of its desktop file's OrganizationName and
 * ApplicationName, which is `postivene.postivene`; the adaptor below owns
 * it and the notification's remote action names it, so lipstick's call
 * lands here and is passed on as `openRequested`.
