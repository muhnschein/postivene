/*
 * The wait before something is destroyed, owned by the list rather than
 * by the row.
 *
 * Silica has this already -- `ListItem.remorseAction` -- and puts the
 * countdown in an item parented to the row it was asked for on. For
 * deleting things *out of* a list that is the one place it cannot go: a
 * delete is exactly what destroys rows. Deleting a run of messages lost
 * most of itself on a phone, and the chat list, the profiles list and a
 * group's members were all open to the same thing -- any reload or
 * reorder destroys rows, and a message arriving reorders the chat list.
 *
 * So the wait lives here, beside the list rather than inside it. What is
 * *drawn* is still Silica's own `RemorseItem`, raised by the row over
 * what is going and handed a callback that does nothing; this is what
 * actually acts when a wait is up.
 *
 * Every id carries its own deadline, and the timer is armed for
 * whichever is soonest. One countdown shared between them was tried and
 * was wrong on a phone: it had to be restarted whenever another delete
 * was asked for, so the first message's countdown ran out, the platform
 * put the message back as though nothing had happened, and everything
 * went together when the last countdown ended. One delete on its own
 * looked right, which is why it took a phone to see. `qml_delete_clocks`
 * is that shape, pinned.
 *
 * Whoever holds one of these draws the waiting row -- `pending(id)` says
 * which, `remaining(id)` says how much of the wait is left, for a row
 * rebuilt in the middle of one. A page on its way out calls `flush()`,
 * for the reason ConversationPage writes its draft there: leaving is
 * exactly when a timer has not fired yet, and somebody who asked for a
 * thing to go and then left asked for it to go.
 *
 * A `QtObject` rather than an `Item`: it draws nothing, and an Item
 * declared inside a Column would take a turn in the layout.
