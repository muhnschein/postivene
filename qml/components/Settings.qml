 * The settings that belong to no profile: whether the return key sends,
 * how a message is drawn, what goes out with a link, how much of an
 * attachment arrives unasked, how long a message is kept, how much a
 * notification gives away and whether a muted group can still raise one,
 * and whether webxdc apps are offered at all.
 *
 * They live in dconf under the app's own path, and every page reads
 * them through this one object: the settings page (qml/pages/
 * SettingsPage.qml) writes it, and each value follows its key, so a
 * change made there reaches every open page without either side being
 * told. dconf rather than a property of the window, so the values
 * outlive the app the way a setting should.
 *
 * A singleton rather than a property handed down page by page: a message
 * row three components deep wants the same answer as the page that
 * sends, and the row is loaded on its own in a test.
