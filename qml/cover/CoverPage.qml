/*
 * What the cover has to say while the app is minimised: who is there,
 * and whether any of them has said something new.
 *
 * The heading is laid out as the platform's own covers lay theirs out
 * -- the calendar's, say: the name top left with a line under it, and
 * the number top right, large. Under it, everyone's avatar in a
 * staggered grid, in grey, the few repeated to fill it; whoever has
 * written is drawn in the ambience's own highlight colour, in the cells
 * that are seen whole and nearest the top. Nobody yet -- no chat but
 * the one with oneself and the core's own -- and the cover says so in a
 * line instead.
 *
 * Every profile counts: one ChatList per configured profile, so the
 * number is every unread message on the phone and the grid is everyone
 * the reader talks to, whichever profile they are under. The lists are
 * the cover's own rather than the chat list page's, because a cover
 * outlives any page -- the app can be minimised from anywhere, including
 * onboarding. The people come out of each list as one JSON list
 * (`cover_people`): the grid is laid out in a pass over them, which a
 * view over the rows could not repeat to fill.
