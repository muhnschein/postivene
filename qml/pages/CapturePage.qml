/*
 * The camera, for a picture or a video to send.
 *
 * A page of its own, pushed by URL and connected to, the way the picker
 * pages are: it names a Camera, so a device without one costs this
 * button rather than the conversation, and it reports what was made on
 * `picked` and lets the caller decide what that means -- the same shape
 * as AttachPhotoPage. What is made goes to the captures directory
 * (Captures, capture.rs), where it waits to be sent; the core copies a
 * sent file into its own directory, and the page that sent it discards
 * the capture afterwards.
 *
 * Laid out as the platform's own camera lays itself out: the viewfinder
 * on black, as large as the sensor's frame lets it be above the
 * controls, and the controls in the black below it -- the two modes
 * stacked on the left with the current one lit, the shutter in the
 * middle, the other camera on the right. The time sits over the bottom
 * of the viewfinder, above the shutter, while a video records: the top
 * of the screen is under a notch on some phones.
 *
 * The sensor's frame is the phone's landscape whichever way the phone
 * is held. The platform's camera writes the turn into the file rather
 * than turning the pixels -- a still's EXIF orientation, a video's
 * rotation -- from the orientation sensor, and so does this page.
 *
 * A still is written where it is asked to go. A video is written where
 * the recorder decides to put it, and is not done when it is stopped:
 * the recorder finalises the file first, and only then is it reported.
 * The recorder's own state is what the page draws from -- a tap on
 * record that the pipeline did not take leaves nothing half-armed --
 * and a stop the recorder ignores is followed by stopping the camera,
 * which finishes the file the way leaving the page does.
 *
 * The camera runs only while this page is the one on screen, and the
 * page takes itself down once it has something to report: a capture is
 * the answer to the question the page asks.
