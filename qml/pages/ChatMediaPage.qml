/*
 * Everything of one kind that a chat holds: its pictures and videos as a
 * grid, its sounds, files or apps as a list. Reached from the tiles on
 * the contact's or the group's page (components/MediaKinds.qml), and
 * the same four pages deltachat-android and deltachat-ios keep behind a
 * profile.
 *
 * The grid is the gallery app's: square cells the platform's thumbnailer
 * fills, a play mark over a video, as many columns as fit. The list is
 * the conversation's own attachment rows without the bubbles -- a voice
 * message plays where it sits, an app runs on a tap, a file is handed
 * to whatever opens it, the three answers a tap gets in the chat --
 * with who sent it and when above each.
 *
 * A long press offers, on every kind, the message's place in the chat
 * and its deletion, and on a file what the chat's row menu offers one:
 * a copy, and another app. Deleting waits out the platform's countdown
 * first, held beside the views rather than on the row (PendingRemoval,
 * the conversation's arrangement); showing a message in the chat is a
 * walk back down the stack to the conversation this was opened over.
 *
 * Nothing here is sorted. The core answers newest last, the model turns
 * that round, and the rows stand in that order (chat_media.rs).
