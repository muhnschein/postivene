/*
 * Who a one-to-one chat is with: their picture, their name, the line they
 * wrote about themselves, and whether the connection is checked and
 * encrypted. Reached by swiping left from the conversation, the way the
 * group page is from a group.
 *
 * Nothing here is an address. A reader of a chatmail app has no use for
 * one, and the core's own words for a contact are the name, the picture
 * and the status line.
 *
 * The name can be the reader's own for them: the name under the picture
 * wears an edit badge, a tap on it turns the name into a field, and what
 * is typed there is what the contact is called here. Leaving it blank
 * goes back to theirs -- the core's own rule for an empty name -- and the
 * name stands there again the next time the page is seen. Applied a
 * pause after typing stops and again on the way out, the way the group
 * page renames a group.
 *
 * The same ChatInfo as the group page: a one-to-one chat has one member,
 * the contact, so the model that lists a group's members lists them. The
 * row is read into properties of the page rather than drawn from, so a
 * reload -- every save is one -- does not rebuild what the reader is
 * looking at, or the field under their thumb.
