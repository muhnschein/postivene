/*
 * One picture, as big as the screen will show it.
 *
 * Tapping an image used to hand it to whatever the system thought handled
 * the type, which left Postivene and, on a device, failed there. Showing it
 * here is a page and a Flickable; the way out to another app stays in the
 * pull-down for the cases this cannot do anything with.
 *
 * The picture is fitted at zoom 1 and multiplied from there, and the
 * flickable's content is the larger of the picture and the view -- so
 * panning does nothing until there is something to pan, and the picture
 * stays centred while there is not.
 *
 * It arrives in two steps. The row that was tapped has already decoded
 * the picture at its own width, and that decode is what this page draws
 * first: a cache hit, so the page comes in with the picture on it and
 * nothing decoding behind the transition. The full-size decode, and a
 * GIF's movie, start once the page is in place. Decoding during the
 * transition was the stutter reported on opening a picture.
 *
 * Saving copies the file into the Pictures folder, where the gallery
 * finds it: what the chat holds lives in the core's own directory and
 * goes with the app.
