/*
 * One profile, as everyone else sees it and as this device holds it: the
 * picture, the name on every message, the line under it, the address it
 * writes from, whether the other end is told when something has been
 * read, and how the relay and the phone are doing by it. Reached from the
 * profile's row on the profiles page. The settings that belong to no
 * profile are on the settings page instead (SettingsPage.qml).
 *
 * The editable parts are core config keys rather than a record of their
 * own, so this page owns a Profile object over get_config/set_config
 * instead of a model. Nothing is confirmed: edits apply a moment after
 * typing stops and again on the way out, and the switch applies on the
 * tap. A settings page that needs saving is a settings page that loses
 * what was typed when someone swipes back.
 *
 * The name sits under the picture and wears the same edit badge; a tap
 * turns it into a field (EditableName.qml). The connectivity and the
 * mailbox quota follow parla's profile dialog (github.com/trufae/parla):
 * the core's own band for the connection, with a dot in the colour the
 * core's own report uses; the bar for the mailbox, always there, at
 * nothing until the relay has said; and under it what is used, what is
 * left and what there is, read off the core's report. What parla's
 * "Details" dialog adds -- the storage per conversation, scanned message
 * by message -- is not here: on a phone that scan is what the reader
 * would be waiting on.
