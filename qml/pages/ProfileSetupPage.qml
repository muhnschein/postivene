/*
 * The work behind AddProfileDialog: the core asks the relay for an
 * account, stores what it answers, and starts IO; this page shows the
 * progress meanwhile and lands in the chat list when it is done. Cancel
 * and a failure both go back to the dialog, which still has what was
 * typed.
 *
 * Silica makes a dialog's accept destination the moment the dialog comes
 * on screen, so that it can be peeked at, and the dialog fills the name
 * and relay in on accept. So nothing happens here on creation: the work
 * starts when the page is the one on screen, which is after both.
 *
 * A relay is somebody's spare-time server, and one that is down holds
 * the core for minutes. So the page says as much once the wait has gone
 * past four seconds, under the Cancel button that has been there all
 * along; and the shim gives up on the relay for the reader at thirty
 * (signup.rs), which lands here as a time-out with the way back.
