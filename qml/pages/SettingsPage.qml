/*
 * The settings that belong to no profile: how a message is drawn, what
 * goes out with a link, how much of an attachment arrives unasked, how
 * long a message is kept, how much a notification gives away and whether
 * a muted group can still raise one, and whether webxdc apps are offered
 * at all. Reached from the chat list's pull-down. A profile's own
 * settings -- picture, name, address, read receipts, what the relay says
 * -- are on the profile's page, reached from its row on the profiles page.
 *
 * The values live in dconf, behind the `Settings` singleton every page
 * reads (qml/components/Settings.qml); this page writes the same object,
 * so a change here reaches every open page without either side being
 * told. They were briefly a page in the system's Settings app instead,
 * which never showed up on a device: the entry that puts a page there is
 * outside the paths Harbour allows, and it turned out to need more than
 * that entry to appear at all.
 *
 * Nothing here needs saving: each control writes its setting on the tap.
 * The one exception is the deletion period, which deletes messages the
 * moment it is set, so that one asks first -- on a page of its own, with
 * the count of what would go.
