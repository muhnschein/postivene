/*
 * A webxdc app, running.
 *
 * The app is a zip somebody sent, and it is *served* rather than
 * unpacked: the shim puts it on a loopback address of its own, reading
 * every file out of the archive through the core, and this points a
 * WebView at that address (`webxdc_host.rs`). The API the app talks to
 * the chat through is injected by the same host, so nothing here has to
 * reach into the page.
 *
 * A page of its own, pushed by URL, for the reason the picker pages are:
 * `Sailfish.WebView` is the one type in this tree that resolves only on a
 * release that ships the browser engine, and here that costs this page
 * rather than the conversation it was opened from.
 *
 * The object is what serves the app, so leaving the page stops it: the
 * page is destroyed on the way out, the object with it, and the socket
 * closes. Nothing has to be remembered to be cleaned up later.
