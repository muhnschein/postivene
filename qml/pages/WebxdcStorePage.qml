/*
 * Where an app comes from: the webxdc store, as a page.
 *
 * A file browser filtered to *.xdc was the first answer, and it is the
 * wrong one for the common case -- somebody who wants to play a game with
 * a friend has no .xdc on their phone yet and no idea where to get one.
 * deltachat-android opens the store instead, and so does this.
 *
 * The store is an ordinary website. What is not ordinary is what happens
 * when a link to an app is followed: a .xdc is a download to the engine,
 * which would save it into the browser's world where this app cannot
 * reach it -- and a download is not a navigation, so watching where the
 * view goes never hears about it at all. That was this page's first
 * answer and it did nothing on a phone.
 *
 * deltachat-android decides every navigation itself
 * (`shouldOverrideUrlLoading`) and fetches an .xdc through the core.
 * There is no such hook here, so the tap is caught where it happens: a
 * frame script in the engine's own world (qml/webxdc/catch.js) stops a
 * click on a link to an app and sends the address back over the message
 * channel, and the file is fetched through the core (`WebxdcStore`).
 * Everything else is left alone, so the store browses as a website.
 *
 * Three ways in, because only the first is certain: the frame script's
 * message, the view's own `linkClicked`, and a navigation that does
 * commit. An app is taken once however it arrives.
 *
 * Pushed by URL and reporting on `picked`, as the picker pages are and
 * for the same reason: `Sailfish.WebView` resolves only where the browser
 * engine is installed, and here that costs this page rather than the
 * conversation it was opened from.
