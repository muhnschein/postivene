/*
 * What the platform hands this app when something is shared to it: a
 * picture from the gallery, a link from the browser, a file from the file
 * manager.
 *
 * An app becomes one of the entries in the share sheet by saying so in
 * its own desktop file -- `X-Share-Methods`, and a group per method
 * naming what it is called and which types it takes -- and by having a
 * `ShareProvider` of the same name running in it. Nothing is installed
 * outside the app for this: the older way, a plugin in the transfer
 * engine's own directory, is not open to a Harbour package and this is.
 *
 * Loaded rather than declared, from postivene.qml, for the reason the
 * webxdc pages are pushed by URL: `Sailfish.Share` resolves only on a
 * release that has it, and an import that does not resolve must cost this
 * file rather than the window every page is loaded into.
 *
 * What arrives is taken to the window, which asks which chat it is for.

    /*
     * The words the share sheet shows.
     *
     * It reads them from the desktop file, which no catalogue reaches --
     * a desktop entry carries its own translations, as `Description[de]`
     * and so on. They are written here as well so `lupdate` collects
     * them and the desktop file can be filled from the same catalogues
     * everything else is translated in. harbour-maelstrom, which is
     * where this app learnt the mechanism, does the same.
     *
     * Both must match the `Description=` of the group of the same name
     * in harbour-postivene.desktop, which tests/qml_syntax.rs checks.
