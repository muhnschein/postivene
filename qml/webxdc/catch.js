/*
 * Take a tap on an app before the browser engine can download it.
 *
 * This is not part of the interface: it is a *frame script*, loaded into
 * the browser engine's own world by `WebxdcStorePage.qml` and running
 * beside the store's page rather than inside this app. Nothing else in
 * qml/ is JavaScript for the engine, which is why it is here on its own.
 *
 * The store is an ordinary website, and a link to an app is a link to a
 * .xdc file. Following one is a download to the engine: it saves the
 * file somewhere this app cannot reach and there is nothing to show for
 * the tap. deltachat-android answers this in `shouldOverrideUrlLoading`
 * -- every navigation is the app's to decide, and an .xdc is fetched
 * through the core instead. Sailfish's WebView has no such hook, so the
 * decision is made where the tap happens: a click on a link to an app is
 * stopped here and handed back over the message channel, and the page
 * fetches it through the core (`WebxdcStore`).
 *
 * Only .xdc links are taken. Everything else -- the store's own pages,
 * its search, a link to somebody's homepage -- is left to the engine, so
 * the store browses as a website should.
