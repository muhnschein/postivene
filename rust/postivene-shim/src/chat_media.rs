//! The pictures, sounds, files or apps of one chat: what the pages behind
//! the tiles on a contact's or a group's page list.
//!
//! The core keeps the index. `get_chat_media` answers with the ids of
//! every message of up to three kinds in a chat, oldest first, and its
//! own note says not to sort them again -- so the list is turned round,
//! newest first being what a gallery shows, and nothing else is done to
//! its order. Three kinds is the core's limit for one call, and that is
//! what shapes the four pages: the reference clients' four tabs each fit
//! in one.
//!
//! The messages behind the ids are read the way the conversation reads
//! its own, in pages of fifty through `get_messages`, but from the top
//! down without waiting to be asked: every row stands as a placeholder
//! from the moment the ids are in, so the page knows how many there are,
//! and the first screen is filled before the rest have been read. A chat
//! with a thousand pictures costs twenty calls in the background and
//! nothing the reader waits on. What has been read is kept across a
//! reload, so a picture arriving while the page is open is one row
//! fetched and nothing moved.
