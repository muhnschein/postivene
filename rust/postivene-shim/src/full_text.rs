//! The whole text of a message too long for the bubble it arrived in.
//!
//! A message the sending core cut in two has its rest behind
//! `get_message_html` and nowhere else, and even one it did not cut can
//! run longer than a bubble should be. Either way what the reader wants
//! is a page, a scrollbar and the words.
//!
//! Only a message. A file somebody attached was read here too for a
//! while, so that a note or a to-do list could be shown rather than
//! handed to a phone that has nothing to open it with -- and the reader
//! whose problem that was said plainly that there should be no such
//! page. A file is opened elsewhere or kept; reading belongs to
//! messages.
//!
//! The Markdown rendering is made here as the message list makes its
//! own, so the page draws what the reader's setting asks for without
//! going back to the shim for it.
