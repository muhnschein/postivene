//! The core's message HTML, as text.
//!
//! A long message is not sent whole. The sending core cuts the body at
//! `DC_DESIRED_TEXT_LEN` and puts the rest in an HTML part, so what
//! arrives in `text` ends in `[...]` and the whole of it is only behind
//! `get_message_html`. Every client that offers "show full message" goes
//! that way; there is no other way to the rest of the words.
//!
//! What comes back is a mail's HTML, and this app has no business
//! rendering one: a `WebView` for a message body is the tracking pixel
//! the whole of `markdown.rs` exists to keep out. So the markup is taken
//! off and the words are kept, which is what the reader wanted -- and
//! what parla does with the same answer, for the same reason.
//!
//! This is not an HTML parser and cannot become one. It is four
//! substitutions over the shape mail bodies actually have, and its output
//! is plain text: whatever it fails to strip is shown as the angle
//! brackets it is, never as markup.
