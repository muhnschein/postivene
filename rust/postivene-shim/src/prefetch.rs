//! Loading a conversation before the page that shows it exists.
//!
//! Opening a chat used to fetch it while the page was still transitioning
//! in, which is what made the transition stutter. Deferring the fetch to
//! the end of the transition stopped the stutter and replaced it with a
//! wait: the page arrives empty and fills a moment later.
//!
//! So the fetch moves earlier instead -- before the push, while the
//! reader is still looking at the chat list. What it finds is left here
//! for the model that the page then builds, which takes it without going
//! near the core, and the page arrives with its rows already in it.
//!
//! One chat is kept, the one most recently asked for. It is taken rather
//! than read, so a second page built from the same account and chat --
//! reopening it half an hour later, say -- does a normal fetch and cannot
//! be served something stale.
