//! A voice message, recorded through the platform's own audio stack.
//!
//! QML on Qt 5.6 has no audio recorder: `QAudioRecorder` is C++ only, and
//! qmetaobject does not bind it. So this is the tree's second `cpp!`
//! block, after the translator (`postivene-app/src/translations.rs`), and
//! the reason the shim has a C++ build step: the recorder is made, driven
//! and asked about from the few lines of C++ below, and everything else
//! is Rust. The exception is kept to this module, and to blocks short
//! enough to be checked by reading.
//!
//! What is recorded goes through `GStreamer` on a device, in whatever
//! codec and container it offers, in the order every client can play:
//! AAC, which the phone clients record, then MP3 and FLAC, and only
//! then Opus or Vorbis in Ogg, which the iOS client shows as a file
//! rather than a voice message (`CODECS` says more). The file lands
//! in the captures directory (`capture.rs`) and is sent as a voice
//! message -- the core's `Voice` view type, which is what draws it as one
//! at the other end rather than as a music file.
//!
//! Nothing is connected to the recorder's signals: the page polls, on a
//! timer it runs only while recording, which is one call rather than a
//! signal bridge. Stopping is asynchronous in the `GStreamer` backend --
//! the file is finished a moment after `stop()` returns -- so the
//! recording is reported once the recorder says it is no longer
//! finalising, from that same poll.

// `cpp!` expands to a call across the FFI boundary, which is `unsafe` by
// construction. Scoped to this file: the workspace denies it everywhere
// else, and docs/BUILDING.md says why this one is allowed.
