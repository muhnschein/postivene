//! A webxdc app: what the core knows about one, and running it.
//!
//! A webxdc is an app somebody sent: a zip with an index.html in it, which
//! everyone in the chat runs their own copy of and which keeps the copies
//! in step by sending status updates through the chat. The core does all
//! of that -- it decides a file is one, keeps its updates, and reads the
//! archive -- so what is left here is showing the app and running it.
//!
//! Showing it is [`extras`], which fills in the three fields a message row
//! draws: the app's name, what it currently says about itself, and its
//! icon, written once into the cache because QML draws a picture from a
//! path rather than from bytes.
//!
//! Running it is [`WebxdcApp`], which starts the loopback host in
//! `webxdc_host.rs` and hands QML the URL to point a `WebView` at. Closing
//! the page drops the object, which stops the host.
