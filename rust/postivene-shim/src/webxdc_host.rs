//! The loopback host one webxdc app is served from while it is open.
//!
//! A webxdc app is a zip file, and the `WebView` needs its files as a
//! website: an index.html that can pull in its own scripts, styles and
//! pictures. Nothing here opens the zip. Every file comes from the core,
//! which reads the archive itself (`get_webxdc_blob`) -- so the app is
//! served rather than unpacked, and no archive format is parsed in this
//! repository.
//!
//! Serving it over HTTP is also what gives the app a way back: the API in
//! `webxdc.js` sends an update with a POST and collects the others by
//! polling, so the bridge needs nothing of the `WebView` beyond the URL it
//! is pointed at. The alternative -- a Gecko frame script -- would put
//! the bridge on chrome-privileged ground this app cannot test.
//!
//! The app is served from the root of that address, as every other
//! client serves one. It has to be: an app built with a bundler's
//! default settings asks for `/assets/index-1a2b.js`, and a host that
//! keeps its files under a prefix answers nothing to that -- which is a
//! blank screen for half the apps in the store and a working one for the
//! half that happens to use relative paths.
//!
//! What keeps that from being a hole in the phone:
//!
//! - the listener is bound to 127.0.0.1 on a port the kernel picks, so
//!   nothing off the device can reach it at all;
//! - a request whose `Host:` is not the address the app was given is
//!   refused, so a name that resolves to 127.0.0.1 is not a way in;
//! - the chat is behind an unguessable token: the two API paths -- what
//!   everyone else in the chat has said, and saying something to them --
//!   are under `/webxdc-api/<token>/`, which the app is told and nothing
//!   else can guess. A page that found the port could ask for the app's
//!   own files, which its reader was sent anyway; it cannot read the
//!   chat or write to it.
//! - it exists only while the app is open, and answers nothing once the
//!   page is closed;
//! - the app itself is confined by a content-security-policy that permits
//!   this origin and nothing else, so a webxdc cannot reach the network
//!   even though it is on one.
