//! Fetches for the rows around a moving reader overlap.
//!
//! One fetch at a time was not enough. A reader flinging up through the
//! history moves faster than a round trip, and a fetch for rows they had
//! already passed held up the fetch for the rows in front of them until it
//! landed: a screen of blanks for as long as that took, reported from a
//! phone as an empty screen for a second on a fast scroll.
//!
//! What is pinned here is that a second ask, made while the first is still
//! in the air, goes out at once -- and that both land in place.
