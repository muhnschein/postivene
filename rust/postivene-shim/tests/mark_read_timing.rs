//! Opening a chat has to clear its unread badge, even when the page was
//! not yet on screen at the moment the messages arrived.
//!
//! `reading_history` exists so a reader scrolled up in history, or an app
//! sitting in the background, does not send read receipts for messages
//! nobody has looked at. It is driven from `readerIsLooking`, which is
//! false until the page transition finishes -- and a local fetch can
//! easily finish first. Checking it once, when the load returns, means a
//! chat opened that way is never marked read at all: the badge stays
//! forever, because everything afterwards only marks messages that
//! *arrive*.

// Qt harness: see chat_actions.rs.
