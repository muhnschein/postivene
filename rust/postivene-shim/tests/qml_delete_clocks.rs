//! Each message deleted goes when its own wait is up, not when the last
//! one's is.
//!
//! Reported from a phone, and it was a design mistake rather than an
//! accident: the list kept one countdown for everything waiting and
//! restarted it on every new delete. So deleting one message and then
//! another a second later meant the first message's countdown ran out,
//! the platform put the message back as though nothing had happened, and
//! then both went together when the second countdown ended. One delete
//! on its own looked right, which is why it took a phone to see.
//!
//! Every id carries its own deadline now, and the timer is armed for
//! whichever is soonest. What this pins is the shape a shared countdown
//! cannot produce: asked a second apart, the first is gone while the
//! second is still waiting.
