//! Deleting several messages, one after another.
//!
//! Each one waits a moment before it goes, so the reader can say they
//! did not mean it. That wait used to belong to the row --
//! `ListItem.remorseAction` puts it there -- and deleting a handful in a
//! row lost most of them on a phone. Why is not established: Silica's
//! `RemorseItem` runs its callback rather than dropping it when the
//! countdown is cut short, so "the row went and took the wait with it"
//! is not the mechanism. What is certain is that deleting out of a list
//! destroys rows, and that a wait beside the list cannot be lost that
//! way at all.
//!
//! So the wait belongs to the list, which outlives every row in it, and
//! what this pins is that nothing happening to the rows can lose a
//! delete: a row destroyed mid-countdown, a delete asked for while
//! others are already waiting, and the reader leaving the chat before
//! the wait is up.
//!
//! What draws the wait is Silica's own `RemorseItem` -- the bar, the
//! seconds, "Tap to cancel" -- raised by the row and handed a callback
//! that does nothing, because the deletion is the list's. So the way
//! back is a tap on the platform's countdown, and it puts back only the
//! one it covers.
