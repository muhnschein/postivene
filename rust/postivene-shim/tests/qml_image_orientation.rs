//! A photo is shown the way it was taken.
//!
//! Reported from a device: an image sent from Postivene arrived the right
//! way up for the person receiving it and lay on its side in our own
//! message view. Cameras do that -- the sensor reads out landscape however
//! the phone is held, and the file says which way to turn it afterwards, in
//! an EXIF tag rather than in the pixels. Every other client honours the
//! tag. `Image` does not, unless it is asked to.
//!
//! Two things follow from asking it, and this pins both. `autoTransform`
//! makes the decoded image the size it is meant to be seen at -- eight
//! wide by sixteen high, for a file stored sixteen by eight and marked
//! "rotate 90". And the row has to be measured from *that* rather than from
//! the dimensions the core read out of the file's header, which are the
//! stored ones: a picture turned a quarter turn in a box shaped for the
//! other orientation is a picture with most of its bubble empty.
//!
//! The fixture below is a whole baseline JPEG, written out by hand, because
//! nothing in the tree can encode one and the only honest way to test what
//! a decoder does with a tag is to hand it a file carrying the tag.
