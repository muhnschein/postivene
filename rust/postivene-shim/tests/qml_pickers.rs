//! The two picker pages, loaded on their own.
//!
//! They are pages rather than Components inside `ConversationPage`, precisely
//! so that a `Sailfish.Pickers` type that is not there costs one button
//! instead of the whole conversation -- which also means nothing else loads
//! them, and without this nothing would notice them breaking.
//!
//! What can be checked here is our half: that each page reports the chosen
//! path on `picked`, and reports nothing when the picker was left without a
//! choice. That the Silica types themselves exist is a device question, and
//! `tests/silica-stubs` cannot answer it.

// Qt harness: see qml_chat_list.rs.
