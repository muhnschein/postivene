//! Coming back to a conversation puts the reader exactly where they were.
//!
//! The place is remembered as a row when the page goes under another and
//! held while it is away, because the list used to be torn down under a
//! pushed page and come back at the top of whatever it had loaded. The
//! hold put the row in the *centre* of the view, which is not where it was:
//! it was wherever the reader had stopped, half a row above the centre or
//! a line below it. So every return ended with the rows moving that far,
//! up or down depending on the row -- a jump the moment the swipe back had
//! finished, felt on a phone once the rest of the return was smooth.
//!
//! Pinned here: a view that has not moved while away does not move on the
//! way back, and one that lost its place while away is put back to the
//! pixel, not to the nearest row's centre.
