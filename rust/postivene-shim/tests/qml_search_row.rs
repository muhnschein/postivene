//! A search result stays inside the screen, and has a height at all.
//!
//! The title's width is the row minus the time label's; the time label
//! was anchored back to the title. Neither width resolved, so the title
//! never learned how wide it was and a long one ran off the right-hand
//! edge instead of fading out. A binding loop is not a load error and
//! nothing else here would have caught it.
//!
//! Then a later patch deleted the row's `Avatar` and left the three
//! references to it behind. The row's height and the title's x are both
//! measured off it, so both bindings threw, the height stayed at its
//! default 0, and a search showed "Chats (1)" with nothing under it. An
//! unresolved id is a runtime warning, not a load error, so that was not
//! a load failure either -- and the checks above all pass on a row of no
//! height. Hence the geometry at the end.
