//! The page a webxdc app runs on: what it points the view at, and what it
//! says while there is nothing to point it at yet.
//!
//! The view itself is a stub (`tests/silica-stubs`), because the browser
//! engine is a device question this cannot answer. What it *can* answer is
//! everything around it: that the page starts the app, hands the view the
//! address the shim served it on, names the app in its own header, offers
//! the source only when the app has one, and stops serving on the way out.
//!
//! Leaving is the page being destroyed, which is what popping one and
//! replacing the stack both are -- and *not* another page opening over
//! it. `sendToChat` opens the chat picker over the app at the app's own
//! request, so a page that stopped its app whenever it deactivated
//! stopped it in the middle of the request that asked. Both halves are
//! here, and the address is asked rather than assumed: a host that has
//! stopped refuses the connection.
