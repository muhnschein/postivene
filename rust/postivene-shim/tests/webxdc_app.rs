//! Running a webxdc app: what the loopback host serves, and to whom.
//!
//! The app is served rather than unpacked, so every file it loads is a
//! request that has to reach the core and come back as the right bytes
//! with the right headers -- and every request that is *not* the app's has
//! to be refused. Both halves are driven here over a real socket, against
//! the fake core, with the same `WebxdcApp` a page instantiates.
//!
//! The round trip is the point of the last part: an update posted by the
//! page reaches the core, the core says so as an event, and the object
//! that started the app has the new summary. That is the whole bridge, in
//! the direction that cannot be checked by reading the JavaScript.
//!
//! `sendToChat` is the other direction and does not go to the core at
//! all: the specification says the reader is asked which chat, so the
//! host writes the file out and raises it on the object for the page to
//! act on. What is pinned here is that a request reaches that signal
//! with a file on the disk to show for it, and that an app cannot use
//! it to write outside the cache.
