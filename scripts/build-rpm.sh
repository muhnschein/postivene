# Build the Postivene RPM for a Sailfish device, using the Sailfish SDK.

#     scripts/build-rpm.sh [<arch>] [<sfos-target-version>]
#
# Defaults to aarch64 and whatever SDK target that arch resolves to; pass a
# version to pin one, e.g.:
#
#     scripts/build-rpm.sh aarch64 5.0.0.62
#     scripts/build-rpm.sh armv7hl
#
# Requirements (none of which can be substituted -- see docs/MILESTONES.md):
#   * Sailfish SDK with the *Docker* build engine. The VirtualBox build
#     engine cannot compile Rust.
#   * An installed build target for the arch. `sfdk tools list -a` lists
#     what is available.
#
# `sfdk build` runs every SPEC section except %prep, i.e. it builds from
# this working tree in place -- which is why the deltachat-rpc-server
# binaries fetched below (gitignored, not committed) are picked up without
# any tarball/vendoring step.

The RPM cannot be produced without the Sailfish SDK: the app links against
the target's Qt 5.6 and glibc, so it has to be compiled inside a Sailfish
build target. Install the SDK (Docker build engine), then re-run this
script. See https://docs.sailfishos.org/Tools/Sailfish_SDK/
