at commit $commit ($date), by scripts/update-harbour-rules.sh.
ci/harbour-validate-rpm.sh runs the validator from that same commit.

They carry that project's licence, GPL-2.0-or-later, which Postivene's own
GPL-3.0-or-later terms accept. rpmvalidation.sh itself is not vendored:
ci/harbour-check.sh reimplements the checks that a source tree can answer,
and .github/workflows/rpm.yml runs the real script against a built RPM.
