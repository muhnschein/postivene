# Generate the offline crate sources the `--with vendor` build mode of
# rpm/harbour-postivene.spec expects:
#
#     rpm/vendor.tar.xz   -- `cargo vendor` output, packed as rust/vendor/
#     rpm/vendor.toml     -- the [source] replacement stanza cargo prints
#
# OBS (and therefore Chum) builds run without network access, so crates
# cannot be fetched during %build there; these two extra sources are what
# make an offline build possible. A plain `sfdk build` inside the SDK does
# have network and does not need them.
#
# Neither file is committed (see .gitignore): they are regenerated from
# rust/Cargo.lock, which is committed and is the actual pin.
